## 📖 About The Project

**Classmate AI** is a comprehensive student productivity ecosystem designed to help users learn smarter, not harder. It combines an intelligent AI assistant with essential academic tools like task management, note-taking, and attendance tracking into a single, cohesive platform.

Unlike generic study tools, Classmate utilizes **Google's Gemini AI** to not just answer questions, but to actively help structure learning goals, generate detailed study phases, and convert chat interactions into actionable tasks and notes.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Chatbot
* **Powered by Gemini**: Integration with Google's Gemini Pro for high-quality, context-aware responses.
* **Customizable Persona**: Configure the AI's tone (Friendly, Professional, Humorous) and custom instructions via Settings.
* **Voice Interaction**: Built-in speech-to-text support for hands-free querying.
* **Smart Actions**: One-click options to copy code, save responses as **Notes**, or convert study plans directly into the **Task Manager**.
* **Markdown & Code Support**: Full rendering for mathematical formulas, tables, and syntax-highlighted code blocks.

### 📋 Smart Task Manager
* **AI Goal Generation**: Input a broad goal (e.g., "Learn Python"), and the system automatically breaks it down into structured **Phases** and detailed **Tasks**.
* **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for individual goals and overall completion.
* **Organization**: Pin and highlight important tasks.

### 📝 Dynamic Notes
* **Flexible Formats**: Support for both rich text notes and checklist-style notes.
* **Organization**: Filter, search, pin, and highlight notes for easy access.
* **Attachments**: Upload and view images or PDFs directly within your notes.

### 📊 Progress Dashboard
* **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts (powered by Chart.js) displaying goal completion rates, task statistics, and note activity.
* **Activity Log**: A timeline view of your recent actions and accomplishments.

### 📅 Attendance Calculator
* **Safe-Bunk Calculator**: Calculate how many classes you can afford to miss while maintaining your target percentage.
* **Recovery Planner**: Determine how many consecutive classes you need to attend to recover a low attendance percentage.

### 🔐 Secure & Personalized
* **Authentication**: Secure User Registration and Login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Dark Mode**: Fully responsive dark/light theme toggling across the entire application.
* **Profile Management**: Update user details, avatars, and passwords.
